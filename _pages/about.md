Hi there! I'm Jong Myoung Kim, a Ph.D. candidate at KAIST. I work on large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP), especially focusing on making language models smarter and more flexible. I've been building datasets that better reflect how people actually speak, designing easier ways to transfer knowledge from English models to other non-English models, and finding simple tricks to make embeddings work better across languages.

I'm passionate about creating AI that understands real-world language â€” even when it's messy, incomplete, or a little ambiguous. In the bigger picture, I'm driven by the idea that technology should work well for everyone, no matter what language they speak. This is why along with my colleagues at KAIST and SK Telecom, I dedicated much of my time recently to build Stratapilot, the next-gen copilot agent for your everyday OS tasks. The Stratapilot project is made possible by MCP, a protocol that allows an LLM to communicate its knowledge with other LLMs or even legacy applications. I believe that with MCP, my dream of having a fully intelligent digital assistant can finally come true. As with all other open-source projects, help on development of Stratapilot is always welcome. Let's build together!
